# Contributing to Saladict

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

## How to Contribute

:warning: Unless it is a small hot fix, before you write any code and get your hands dirty, please open an issue or make a WIP pull request to elaborate what you are trying to do and how you are going to implement it. Just to make sure we are on the same page and nobody's time and effort are wasted.

- Read [How to get started](#how-to-get-started).
- Follow [code style](#code-style) and [commit style](#commit-style).
- Before submit, run [test](#testing) and [build](#building) locally. Or leave it to CI.

## How to get started

Clone the repo and run `yarn install`.

## UI Tweaking

Run `yarn start --main=[entry id]` to view a certain entry with WDS in a fake WebExtension environment.

Entry ids are generally directory names in `src`.

`index.[html/js(x)/ts(x)` in `[entry id]/__fake__` has higher priority.

## Testing

Run `yarn test` to run Jest. Supports all the Jest [options](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/cli).

## Building

Run `yarn devbuild` to start a quick build without compression.

Run `yarn build` to start a full build.

Toggle:

- `--notypecheck`: Skip TypeScript full check.
- `--analyze`: Show detailed Webpack bundle analyzer.

## Releasing

Run `yarn release` to bump version and generate [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.md).

## Zipball

Run `yarn zip` to pack zibballs to `./dist/`.

## How to add a dictionary

1. Create a directory at [`src/components/dictionaries/`](./src/components/dictionaries/), with the name of the dict ID.
  1. Use any existing dictionary as guidance, e.g. [Bing](./src/components/dictionaries/bing). Copy files to the new directory.
  1. Replace the favicon with a new LOGO.
  1. Edit `config.ts` to change default options. See the `DictItem` type and explanation for more details. Register the dictionary in [app config](./src/app-config/dicts.ts) so that TypeScript generates the correct typings. Dict ID **MUST** follow alphabetical order.
  1. Update `_locales.json` with the new dictionary name. Add locales for options, if any.
  1. `engine.ts` **MUST** export at least two functions:
     1. `getSrcPage` function which is responsible for generating source page url base on search text and app config. Source page url is opened when user clicks the dictionary title.
     1. `search` function which is responsible for fetching, parsing and returning dictionary results. See the typings for more detail.
        - Extracting information from a webpage **MUST** use helper functions in [../helpers.ts](./components/dictionaries/helpers.ts) for data cleansing.
        - If the dictionary supports pronunciation:
          1. Register the ID at [`config.autopron`](https://github.com/crimx/ext-saladict/blob/a88cfed84129418b65914351ca14b86d7b1b758b/src/app-config/index.ts#L202-L223).
          1. Include an [`audio`](https://github.com/crimx/ext-saladict/blob/a88cfed84129418b65914351ca14b86d7b1b758b/src/typings/server.ts#L5-L9) field in the object which search engine returns.
      1. Other exported functions can be called from `View.tsx` via `DictEngineMethod` message channel, see `src/typings/message` for typing details (also don't use the native `sendMessage` function, import `{ message }` from `'@/_helpers/browser-api'`).
  1. Search result will ultimately be passed to a React PureComponent in `View.tsx`, which **SHOULD** be a dumb component that renders the result accordingly.
  1. Scope the styles in `_style.scss` following [ECSS](http://ecss.io/chapter5.html#anatomy-of-the-ecss-naming-convention)-ish naming convention.

Add Testing

1. Add response samples at `test/specs/components/dictionaries/[dictID]/response`.
1. Add `engine.spec.ts` to test the engine.

Develop the dictionary UI live

1. Intercept ajax calls in [`config/fake-env/fake-ajax.js`](./config/fake-env/fake-ajax.js). Use the testing response samples.
1. Edit [`src/components/__fake__/index.tsx`](./src/components/__fake__/index.tsx).
1. Run `yarn start --main=components`.

## Code Style

This project follows the TypeScript variation of [Standard](https://standardjs.com) JavaScript code style.

If you are using IDEs like VSCode, make sure TSLint related plugins are installed. Or you can just run [building command](#building) to perform a TypeScript full check.

## Commit Style

This project follows [conventional](https://conventionalcommits.org/) commit style.

You can run `yarn commit` and follow the instructions, or use [vscode-commitizen](https://github.com/KnisterPeter/vscode-commitizen) extension in VSCode.
